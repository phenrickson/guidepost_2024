# Background

## 

"For a decade now, Data Scientist has been in the spotlight. AI experts had salaries that rivaled those of sports superstars.

. . .

In the search for fame and fortune, hundreds of young professionals entered into what seemed [a frenetic golden rush]{.fg style="--col: #C6B90B"}... Whole new industries sprang around the hype.

. . .

Consulting specialists promised millions if your company could [unlock the potential of data]{.fg style="--col: #C6B90B"}.  AI, or Machine Learning, has been called the [new electricity]{.fg style="--col: #C6B90B"} and data, the [new oil]{.fg style="--col: #C6B90B"}."[^1]

<!-- This trend has only accelerated in recent years with innovations in the form of large language models and generative artificial intelligence. -->

<!-- . . . -->

But there's a problem.

. . .

Is all of this investment in data science actually worth anything?

##

Most organizations want to advance their capabilities in DS/ML/AI. 

. . .

At the same, most organizations struggle to find value from them. 

. . .

In my humble estimation, I think this is because they are looking for value in the wrong places.

##

What I hear organizations say:

. . .

'We want to start being more predictive.'

'We want to start using AI and machine learning.'

'What AI tools should we buy?'

##

What, really, is the value of data science?

. . .

The value of (data) science is simply that of science - it is the process by which we [try to understand]{.fg style="--col: #75BAFF"} the world around us.

. . .

It allows us to discover [cause and effect]{.fg style="--col: #75BAFF"}; it allows us to [measure things we care about]{.fg style="--col: #75BAFF"}. It helps us understand the data we have and the data that we don’t.

##

To illustrate, I want to tell you two stories of "old fashioned" science in action.

. . .

The second story is about an important topic that affects us all, something that weighs on us everyday and affects the physical well-being of ourselves and our loved ones:  <span class="fragment">**college football**</span>.

. . .

The first story is about **heart disease**.

<!-- "I tend to think of statistics as the **science of patterns in data**. We use statistics to make sense of the world by looking at data and trying to find patterns in it, often by summarizing the data in some way. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- And yet, data science is not just statistics. It isn't something you know **so much as something you do**. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- [Data science] is a **way of thinking about the world**, a **way of making sense of data**, a way of **asking questions and answering them**." -->


<!-- It's a computational thing, a philosophical thing, a sociological thing — even a linguistic thing, if you dig into the details.  -->

<!-- ## -->

<!-- To this end, I believe the easiest way to understand data science is to see examples  -->

<!-- ##  -->

<!-- The data you choose to collect is part of the scientific process. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- Understanding the data you don't have is just as important as the data that you do. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- Prediction comes from *understanding* - understanding the process producing the data you observe. -->


# 1) What causes cardiovascular failure?

##

Have you ever gone to the doctor and received your ten-year cardiovascular risk score?

. . .

Have you ever wondered where that score comes from?

. . .

Would you have guessed that it had something to do with Franklin Delano Roosevelt?

##  {background-image="images/fdr_before.jpg" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}


## 

President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, at the age of 63, from cerebral hemorrhage with a blood pressure of **300/190 mmHg**.

. . .

![](images/blood_pressure.png){fig-align="center"}

## 

By the 1940s, cardiovascular disease had become the number one cause of mortality among Americans, accounting for 1 in 2 deaths.

At this time, **almost nothing was known about the causes of heart failure**.

. . .

Prevention and treatment were so poorly understood that most Americans accepted **early death from heart disease as unavoidable**.

## 

To illustrate:

. . .

In 1932, candidate Roosevelt's campaign office released medical records showing his blood pressure to be **140/100 mmHg**, which did not prompt any medical intervention.

. . .

By 1941, the President experienced a gradual rise in blood pressure to **188/105 mmHg**.

. . .

In March 1944, Dr. Bruenn noted that the patient appeared “slightly cyanotic” with blood pressure of **186/108 mmHg**.

. . .

A month after coming under Dr. Bruenn's care, Roosevelt's blood pressure had risen to **240/130 mmHg**.

## 

In February, 1945, Lord Charles Moran, Churchill's personal physician wrote: "the Americans here cannot bring themselves to believe that he is finished. His daughter thinks he is not really ill, and his doctor backs her up. **I give him only a few months to live**."

. . .

FDR died two months later.

##

FDR's death prompted a national call for the study of cardiovascular disease.

## {background-image="images/heart_act.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

##

On June 16, 1948, President Harry Truman signed into law the National Heart Act.

This law approved a **twenty-year epidemiological heart study** and established the National Heart Institute.

. . .

This study was the brainchild of **Joseph Mountin**, a physician from Hartford, Wisconsin.

##

![](images/mountin.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## 

How do you determine the causes of long term heart risk?

. . .


Joseph Mountin recognized that the problem demanded a long term study; **collecting the right data**.

. . .

"Observations of population characteristics must be made **well before disease becomes overt** if the relationship of these characteristics to the development of the disease is to be established with reasonable certainty."

##

Mountin's recommendation:

. . .

- Study a large group of people over a long period of time who had not yet developed overt symptoms of cardiovascular disease. 

. . .

- Collect data on every individual at the start of the study and during regularly scheduled follow-ups.

. . .

- Observe them. Eventually, some of the individuals would experience cardiovascular disease.

. . .

- Examine the relationship between data collected at the beginning of the study and the onset of the disease.

The town of **Framingham, Massachusetts** was chosen as the location for the study.

##

The town of **Framingham, Massachusetts** was chosen as the location for the study. 

The one-time farming community was now a factory town of 28,000 middle-class residents of predominantly European origin... and was **"therefore considered to be representative of the United States in the 1940s"**.

::: aside

* The original cohort was recruited between 1948 and 1952 and consisted of 5209 residents aged 28 to 62 years. Women comprised more than half of the participants in the study. The study's inclusion of women contrasted with contemporaneous epidemiological studies, which had very small numbers of women or excluded them altogether.

##

What data did they choose to collect?

. . .

A committee of specialists had to **speculate about the potential causes** and develop a variety of hypotheses to guide their data collection.

. . .

They cast a pretty wide net in collecting data on individuals.

## {background-image="images/data_collection.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

##

![](images/framingham_carbon_paper.png){fig-align="center"}

## 

What did they find?

. . .

The first major study findings were published in 1957, almost a decade after the initial participant was examined. 

. . .

They found a nearly 4 fold increase in coronary heart disease incidence per 1000 persons among hypertensive participants (≥160/95 mmHg).

##

Much of what we know about the causes of heart disease (exercise, diet, smoking) was found in the years to come in the more than 3000 papers published using data from the Framingham Heart Study.

. . .

These findings form the basis of the **Framingham Risk Score**, a simple model for estimating long term risk of cardiovascular disease that is used to this day.

. . .

The Framingham study continues; it is now on its **third generation of residents**, examining the effects of family history and genetics.

##

Why am I telling you about this?

. . .

The data you choose to collect, and not collect, is part of the scientific process.

. . .

All of the tools and technology in the world will not help if you do not try to **understand your problem** and the **data that would help you solve it**.

. . .

If this is the case for something **as simple as heart disease**, it can also be true for something much more serious: **college football**.

# 2) How do you measure a college football team?

##

Have you ever looked at pre-game betting lines and win probabilities for football games?

. . .

Have you ever wondered how they make these predictions? It might not be quite what you think.

. . .

Would you have guessed that it had something to do with a quarterback who played in the 1970s?

##  {background-image="images/virgil_carter.jpg" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

##

**Virgil Carter** was an NFL quarterback who played for the Bears and the Bengals in the 1970s.

. . .

***While also being a quarterback in the NFL***, Virgil Carter earned a Master's degree from Northwestern and taught statistics and mathematics at Xavier University.

. . .

The focus of his research, naturally, was football.

How do you evaluate a football team? Virgil Carter's idea was to measure the value of **individual plays** in terms of points.

## Wrapping up

## 

The value of (data) science is simply that of science - it is the process by which we understand the world around us.

. . .

It allows us to discover cause and effect; it allows us to measure things we care about. It helps us understand the data we have and the data that we don’t.

##

There is no easy button; there is no tool that you can buy and start solving all of your problems.

. . .

The value of data science usually doesn't come from technology

. . .

It's in the creatvitiy/dedication/passion/expertise of asking questions 

. . .

I don't think data science is electricity and data the new oil. I think it's something much simpler.

. . .

(Data) science is like farming. 

. . .

It’s slow and difficult. <span class="fragment">You can't take shortcuts.</span> But if you plant the seeds, if you work at it and make an effort everyday, you will produce something in the end.
